                                      <p>After 15 years in the Royal Air Force , I've settled in Lossiemouth, Scotland, where I live with my wife and two children. My journey into tech started with a desire to see how Web pages were built. As my interest grew so did my desire for knowledge, I was fascinated with how easily I could gain more insight and understanding from around the various Internet sites. I was captivated and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit the specific needs of myself and my family and provod the career change I had been looking for.
                                      </p>

                                      <p>Once the desire for more knowledge was there it was hard to shake.  When I learned how to build my first website, I realised I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility, that I also enjoyed with-in a working enviroment. Now I'm in the process of making a career change from an Aircraft Technician to front-end development, where I can use my organisation skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.
