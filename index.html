                                <p>I've made my home base in Lossiemouth, Moray, Scotland, with my two children and Wife. My journey into tech started with a desire to see how Web pages were built. As my intrest grew so did my thirst for knowledge, I was fascinated with how easily I could gain more insight and knowledge from round the Internet. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs of myself and my family.</p>

                                <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realised I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I'm in the process of making a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organisation skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>
