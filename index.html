  <span>Hi</span>,
    I'm <strong>David Pinner</strong>,
      A web Developer and designer with an eye for detail,
        that loves clean & elegant code.</pre>

                                <h2>A little Information about me.</h2>
                                <p class="p1">I've made my home base in Lossiemouth, Moray, Scotland, with my two children and Wife. My journey into tech started with a desire to see how Web pages were built. As my intrest grew so did my thirst for knowledge, I was fascinated with how easily I could gain more insight and knowledge from round the Internet. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit the specific needs of myself and my family.</p>

                                <p class="p2">That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realised I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I'm in the process of making a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organisation skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>
